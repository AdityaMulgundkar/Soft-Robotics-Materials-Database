### Purpose

This repository aims to offer the mechanical characteristics of a wide range of elastomers for soft robotics
applications and thus to aid material selection. Relying on the ASTM D412 testing standards we followed a rigorous protocol to characterize elastomers through tensile testing.

### The Soft Robotics Database App

In addition to visualising raw experimental data, the app allows you to fit a range of constitutive models and extract the respective model parameters for your own soft robotics applications in the **Constitutive Models** section. Detailed information on the test setup used to acquire the experimental data is provided within the app and on the respective [Wiki page](https://github.com/LucMarechal/Soft-Robotics-Materials-Database/wiki/Setup-and-Characterisation). The **Materials Comparison** tab lets you to easily visualise and compare all tested materials to select the right silicone rubber for your soft robot projects.
